For Triangle Strategy - specifically has key. For other games, open xortool-keyoffset.py and change the key.

You can use XorTool's bruteforce function to get the key.

Uses xortool to decrypt XOR encrypted files.
Triangle Strategy's lub filse are encrypted with a 256-byte key. For each file, the starting position of the key is randomly shifted. This tool goes through each possible starting location and checks for the plaintext in 'xortool-keyoffset_plaintext'. For Lua 5.1 files, the plaintext will be 'LuaQ'.

Drag your encrypted file onto xortool-keyoffset.py to use.

Alternatively, use command prompt.
